# 🚖 Taxi Prices EDA

**Dec 2024 - Dec 2024**  
**Associated with Big Blue Data Academy**

## 📊 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Taxi Prices EDA** project! In this project, I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors influencing the price and duration of taxi trips. By analyzing data such as weather conditions 🌦️, traffic levels 🚗, and time of day 🕒, I explored how these variables impact both the cost 💰 and length ⏱️ of a journey.

This project is part of the **Big Blue Data Academy** curriculum, where I applied various data analysis techniques to uncover meaningful insights for the taxi industry.

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** 🧹: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure clean data for analysis.
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis** 🔍: Examined the distribution of taxi prices and trip durations, as well as their relationships with time, weather, and traffic.
- **Correlation Analysis** 🔗: Identified significant drivers of taxi trip pricing and duration.
- **Visualization** 📈: Created heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize data patterns and trends.
- **Insights & Recommendations** 💡: Offered actionable insights, such as the best travel times and how weather and traffic affect trip pricing and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting graphs
- **NumPy**: Numerical analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning

## 📂 Files Included
The project files are organized as follows:
- Taxi_Prices_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- Taxi_Prices_EDA.pptx: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the insights.
- README.md: This file.
- .gitignore: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- Data/: Folder containing the dataset(s) used for analysis.

## 🚀 How to Explore
Follow these steps to open and run the project:

### 1. Install Jupyter Notebook
Since the project includes a **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb` file), you'll need to install Jupyter if it's not already installed on your system. To install Jupyter, run this in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install jupyter

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/apapath/Data-Analysis-Projects.git

### 3. Navigate to the Taxi Prices EDA Folder
Change to the directory where the notebook file is located:

cd Data-Analysis-Projects/Taxi\ Prices\ EDA

### 4. Open the Jupyter Notebook
Once you are in the folder containing the notebook file (e.g., `Taxi_Prices_EDA.ipynb`), start Jupyter Notebook by running:

jupyter notebook

This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. You'll see a file explorer interface where you can click on the `Taxi_Prices_EDA.ipynb` notebook to open it.

### 5. Run the Notebook
Inside the Jupyter Notebook, run the cells one by one by selecting them and pressing `Shift + Enter` or using the "Run" button in the toolbar.

## 📽️ PowerPoint Presentation
In addition to the Jupyter Notebook, the project also includes a **PowerPoint presentation** (`Taxi_Prices_EDA.pptx`) summarizing the key insights from the analysis. You can open and review the presentation to get a quick overview of the project results and recommendations.

Simply open the `.pptx` file using any PowerPoint viewer (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides).
